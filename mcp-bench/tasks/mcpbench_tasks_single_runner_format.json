Some APIs might use a page/page_size setup, others a cursor or next_cursor, and I’m not even sure if all of them support paging in their search calls or if I have to switch to their “list” routes instead. \n\nCould you dig into each service’s search endpoints and tell me:\n• whether it pages at all or not  \n• if it does, what style it uses (page numbers, cursors, etc.)  \n• the exact parameter names, types, required flags, and defaults  \n• any response fields that indicate where to pick up the next batch  \n\nAnd if a service’s search doesn’t page, check its list endpoints the same way.

Cross‐tool linkage: the rsID or HGVS from variant_searcher drives variant_getter.  \n5. Cross‐server NCI–ClinicalTrials.gov linkage: nci_biomarker_searcher retrieves biomarker codes native to NCI’s system, then those codes parameterize trial_searcher on ClinicalTrials.gov to align trial eligibility criteria across two databases.  \n6. Decision branching in trial retrieval: trial_protocol_getter, trial_outcomes_getter, and trial_references_getter operate in parallel per NCT ID; if outcomes are missing, fallback to trial_getter(detail=all).  \n7. Drug lifecycle mapping: drug_getter provides parent drug metadata, feeding into openfda_approval_searcher→openfda_approval_getter for regulatory approval details.  \n8. Safety signal analysis: openfda_label_searcher and openfda_adverse_searcher analyze prescribing information and real‐world adverse event reports for each drug.  \n9. Cross‐validation points: compare trial intervention arms with FDA label indications; verify variant pathogenicity with both literature findings and database annotations; align NCI biomarker usage with trial outcomes and post‐marketing safety data.  \n10.

Then, for each resolved ID, we run Context7:get-library-docs sequentially to fetch the “routing” topic documentation (token limit 5000). A decision point follows: if the difference in code snippet counts between the two libraries exceeds 10, we recommend the library with more examples; otherwise, we trigger a fallback loop invoking get-library-docs again with the refined topic \"dynamic routing\" (token limit 3000) for deeper comparison.

If Steam API is healthy:\n      1) Call get_steam_trending to get the current trending games and their Steam ranking positions.\n      2) From that list, call get_steam_top_sellers and filter to only trending games whose Steam sales rank is worse (numerically greater) than 5 (i.e., trending but not top 5 sellers).\n      3) Call get_steam_most_played and intersect with the filtered list, retaining only games with a current concurrent player count of at least 5,000.\n   b. If Steam API was unhealthy, call get_all_trending once and filter its output for platform == \"Steam\" and apply the same top-sellers and player thresholds above (sales rank > 5, concurrent ≥ 5,000).\n\n3. EPIC GAMES STORE DATA GATHERING (or fallback)\n   a. If Epic API is healthy:\n      1) Call get_epic_trending to get current trending titles and their Epic ranking positions.\n      2) Call get_epic_free to get the list of free games available or upcoming within the next 7 days.\n   b. If Epic API was unhealthy, call get_all_trending once and filter its output for platform == \"Epic Games Store\" and trending status, then separately call get_epic_free for free/upcoming games as above.\n\n4. CROSS-PLATFORM ANALYSIS\n   • From the Steam filtered list and the Epic trending list, identify games present in both lists (cross-platform trending).  \n     – For each, compute average rank = (Steam trending rank + Epic trending rank) / 2.  \n     – Retain only those with average rank ≤ 10.\n   • From the Steam filtered list, identify Steam-only trending games (not in Epic trending).  \n     – For each Steam-only title, verify it is not in the Epic free/upcoming list.  \n   • From the Epic trending list, identify Epic-only trending games (not in Steam filtered list).  \n     – For each Epic-only title, check if it appears in the Epic free/upcoming list.\n\n5. OUTPUT\n   Prepare a JSON report with three arrays:\n   {\n     \"cross_platform_hits\": [ { \"name\": string, \"steam_rank\": int, \"epic_rank\": int, \"average_rank\": float } ],\n     \"steam_only_opportunities\": [ { \"name\": string, \"steam_rank\": int } ],\n     \"epic_only_opportunities\": [ { \"name\": string, \"epic_rank\": int, \"is_free_next_7_days\": boolean } ]\n   }\n\nEnsure every step is automated via the specified tools and that no external data or vague parameters are used.",

If any of those are buzzing on both Steam and Epic, I’d love to see their individual ranks and an averaged ranking—only if that average comes out to ten or below. For games that only pop on Steam, make sure they’re not quietly heading into any Epic free-to-play or upcoming giveaways.

And if any of those look-alikes share IP ranges with the real example-inc.com, flag that as a potential “sibling” setup. \n\nAt the end, I really need solid numbers or output—like actual DNS/DNS record details, open-port findings, and registrar versus network-owner info—so I can show my team real evidence.

On top of that, I’d love to see its eigenvalues and eigenvectors—and even run an SVD or QR to get a feel for its geometry—grab an orthonormal basis for its column space, and re-express the matrix there. When I project my vector onto the first eigenvector, what number do I get? \n\nAs a side project, I’m also exploring the function f(x,y,z)=exp(–0.5*(x²+y²+z²)). Could you tell me its directional derivative at [1.2, –0.8, 0.5] along that leading eigenvector? It’d be great to have the full symbolic gradient of f, plus the divergence and curl of that gradient field. And because I learn best by seeing things, I need a 3D quiver plot of the gradient over x,y,z from –2 to 2 (about 15 points per axis) and a simple 2D curve of exp(–0.5 x²) from x=–3 to 3 with y going from –0.1 to 1.1 (200 samples). \n\nMy advisor wants everything—determinant, inverse matrix, eigenvalues/vectors, singular values, Q and R from QR, your orthonormal basis, the changed-basis form, the projection value, the directional derivative, the gradient expression, divergence, curl—and the two plots all wrapped up in a JSON report.

          "fuzzy_description": "Hey, I’m gearing up for tomorrow’s multidisciplinary rounds and I’ve got three patients that are driving me nuts with all the numbers. First is Mr. A, a 65-year-old guy who’s about 95 kg and 170 cm (so roughly 67″). He’s diabetic, hypertensive, has CHF, prior MI and AF, and he’s headed for a high-risk suprainguinal vascular case. Labs show creatinine 1.8 mg/dL, cystatin C 1.5 mg/L, fasting insulin 20 µIU/mL, fasting glucose 150 mg/dL (but his electrolytes panel spiked his glucose to 200 mg/dL), calcium 8.0 mg/dL with albumin at 3.0 g/dL, sodium 130 mEq/L, total cholesterol 5.2 mmol/L and HDL 1.0 mmol/L. Vitals are 150/90 mmHg, HR 80, QT interval around 380 ms. He’s on oxycodone 5 mg q6h plus a 25 µg/h fentanyl patch, chronic prednisone 10 mg daily, plus standard antihypertensives and a statin. On top of that, his liver numbers—bilirubin 3.0 mg/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL, INR 1.8—with slight ascites and grade 1 encephalopathy—have me wondering about his Child-Pugh and MELD.  \n\nThen there’s a 12-year-6-month-old girl, 50 kg, 150 cm, BP around 120/80, fasting insulin 15 µIU/mL, glucose 100 mg/dL.  \n\nAnd finally a 30-year-old pregnant woman who had her LMP on 2024-02-15 with a 30-day cycle.  \n\nI need to pull together their body metrics (BMI, BSA, ideal vs. adjusted weight), IV fluid rates, creatinine clearance vs. eGFR (and switch to the cystatin‐C equation if it’s under 60), MAP, HOMA-IR, corrected calcium and sodium, QTc, CHA₂DS₂-VASc, Wells’ PE probability, RCRI, Framingham and PREVENT 10-year risk, plus that liver scoring and her obstetric dates. Oh, and converting prednisone 10 mg to hydrocortisone and tallying his daily MME. Can you walk me through the actual calculations with those exact numbers and then tell me what you’d recommend for each? I really need hard data—no loose guesses—so I can confidently present to the team.\n\nPlease ensure all findings are supported by concrete data and verifiable sources. I need specific numbers and evidence, not generalizations.",

Sequential chains for anthropometry → CrCl → eGFR → CVD risk.  \n2. Conditional branching: low eGFR triggers cystatin-C formula; ABW >120% IBW triggers ABW use; HOMA-IR >2.5 toggles diabetes status.  \n3.

          "dependency_analysis": "The workflow begins with anthropometric calculations (bmi_bsa_calculator) to yield BMI/BSA, then height conversion to inches feeds ibw_abw_calculator, producing IBW and ABW. A decision node uses IBW vs actual weight to determine weight_for_crcl, which is input to crcl_cockcroft_gault alongside age, height_inches, scr, sex. Parallel renal function assessments follow: egfr_epi (scr only) and egfr_epi_cr_cys (scr+scys) run in sequence, their outputs compared at a decision point (difference >5 mL/min/1.73 m² triggers selection of the lower eGFR, else the scr-only eGFR) for risk calculators. Three other parallel branches correct electrolytes: corrected_sodium and corrected_calcium, and compute hemodynamics via map_calculator. The selected eGFR, hemodynamics, lipid values, and patient factors feed into prevent_cvd_risk for 10-year CVD risk. A conditional perioperative branch uses risk factors in revised_cardiac_risk_index. A stroke–risk branch uses atrial fibrillation and comorbidities in chads2_vasc_score. Finally, metabolic insight is added via homa_ir. Sequential dependencies ensure output from one tool directly supplies inputs or decision criteria for the next; parallel branches converge into comprehensive risk models.
