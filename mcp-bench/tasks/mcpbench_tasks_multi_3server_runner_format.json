I\u2019m working on a project to build a real-time pandemic outbreak detector, and I want to see what cutting-edge machine learning tricks have popped up in the last three months. Would you mind digging up about the top five preprint studies from the usual archives plus at least three peer-reviewed papers (if any of the archives don\u2019t have enough, maybe grab a few extras via Google Scholar)? Then could you read through them and give me roughly a 150-word summary of each paper\u2019s main algorithmic idea? Once you\u2019ve got those, I\u2019d love a list of the distinct ML approaches they\u2019re using, a quick encyclopedia-style blurb on each technique, and a heads-up on any conferences or workshops in the next week to month where these methods will be featured.

If PREVENT is more than 2% higher than Framingham, could you summarize the top three differences between those two models? While you\u2019re at it, what are her CHA\u2082DS\u2082-VASc (she\u2019s 65, female, hypertension, vascular disease, diabetes) and Revised Cardiac Risk Index (high-risk surgery, on insulin) scores, and a Wells score for PE given her upcoming surgery? I also need her QTc by Bazett\u2019s formula (QT 400 ms, HR 78 bpm), total daily MME if she\u2019s on oxycodone 10 mg four times a day, and a prednisone-to-dexamethasone equivalent for 20 mg of prednisone. Finally, if that PREVENT risk is above 20%, could you pull the top five high-intensity statin therapy recommendations from Wikipedia?

          "dependency_analysis": "1. Sequential dependency: Use OpenAPI Explorer:getApiOverview twice (for \"openai\" and \"github\") to produce two security-scheme lists. 2. Decision point: Compare the two lists; if GitHub includes OAuth2 and OpenAI does not, choose the OAuth2 query; otherwise choose the API key query. 3. Conditional workflow: Primary academic search via Paper Search:search_arxiv; if its result count <3, fallback to Paper Search:search_pubmed. 4. Data flow: The selected query string (from step 2) is passed to Paper Search tools. 5. Inherent dependency: search_arxiv (or search_pubmed) outputs paper metadata containing titles and abstracts ready for summarization\u2014no additional tools needed to extract abstracts. 6. Parallel independent branch: Use Hugging Face:search-models with fixed query \"API security\"; its output provides model_ids for the next step. 7. Sequential dependency: For the top 2 model_ids, call Hugging Face:get-model-info. 8. Cross-server orchestration: Data from OpenAPI Explorer influences Paper Search queries; Paper Search outputs trigger or skip fallback logic; Hugging Face tools run in parallel and feed into the final aggregation. 9. Final aggregation: Combine outputs from all three servers into one structured JSON report.",

Use OpenAPI Explorer:getApiOverview with id=\"openai\" to retrieve the overall structure of the OpenAI spec. 2. Immediately feed id=\"openai\" into swagger-validator to validate the spec and collect all errors/warnings. 3. For each validation error that references an operationId or route, call OpenAPI Explorer:getApiOperation with id=\"openai\" and the operationIdOrRoute from the error to extract full request and response schemas. 4. Repeat steps 1\u20133 for id=\"github\". 5. Use Paper Search:search_arxiv with query=\"OAuth2 API security best practices\" and max_results=3 to find recent academic guidance. 6. For each returned paper_id, call Paper Search:read_arxiv_paper with that paper_id to extract text content and summarize the top five OAuth2 security recommendations. 7. Use Hugging Face:search-collections with query=\"API specification best practices\" and limit=1 to locate a community\u2010curated guideline set. 8. Call Hugging Face:get-collection-info with the namespace and collection_id returned to extract formal recommendations on versioning, schema consistency, deprecation policies, and authentication schemes. 9. Aggregate validation errors from both specs, map missing or misconfigured security schemes (API key vs OAuth2) against the five arXiv guidelines and the Hugging Face collection recommendations. 10. Produce a JSON report with these fields: { \"spec_name\": [\"openai\",\"github\"], \"validation_errors\": {...}, \"operations_missing_oauth2\": [...], \"academic_guidelines_summary\": [...], \"community_recommendations\": {...}, \"mismatches\": [...], \"action_items\": [...] }.

I\u2019m not totally confident the schemas are error-free or that every endpoint is using the right kind of authentication (API key vs. OAuth2), and I\u2019ve heard there are some new best practices floating around in both academic papers and community guides. \n\nCould you take a careful look at each service\u2019s official API description, surface any validation glitches or security-scheme oddities\u2014like endpoints that aren\u2019t actually protected by OAuth when they should be\u2014and then see how those issues line up with the latest OAuth2 recommendations from a handful of recent research papers plus a well-known community-maintained guideline? I\u2019d love a concise breakdown of:\n\n- What errors or warnings you find in each spec\n- Which operations are missing or misconfiguring OAuth2\n- The top security recommendations from the academic side\n- The key dos and don\u2019ts from the community guide\n- A clear set of action items for us to fix all the mismatches\n\nI really need concrete examples and sources\u2014quotable snippets or direct references\u2014so I can justify every point when I report back.
